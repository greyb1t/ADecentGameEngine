GAMMA CORRECTION:
	Loading textures using DirectXTK loads them with *sRGB, so no need to gamma correct in shaders.
	The proper way to gamma correct before displaying on screen is to use SRGB backbuffer texture.
	But because we use ImGui, when drawing ImGui to SRGB backbuffer colors are wrong.
	Therefore we manually turn the pixels into Gamma space before rendering the final result
	to the scene texture.
